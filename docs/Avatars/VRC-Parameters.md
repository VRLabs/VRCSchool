# Built-In VRC Parameters {#abfc26a8270245b3bd77cfec5cfe2d64}


There are certain parameters that are set by VRChat automatically. These parameters will be set on any Playable Layer (such as the FX Layer) for you. VRChat’s [own article](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/animator-parameters/) on this is actually pretty good, so this article adds some common use cases and caveats where applicable. 


Example: If you add a parameter called `IsLocal` to your FX Layer, it will automatically be set to True or False* based on whether or not the avatar is being played locally or remotely.


:::note

These parameters are read-only and will not be set on sub animators, only Playable Layer animators.

The value parameters are set depending on the type of the Parameter. They follow the rules of [Expression Parameter Mismatching](/docs/Other/Parameter-Mismatching), so for example IsLocal as a float would be set to 0.0 or 1.0, while a bool would be set to True or False. Be careful when mismatching Built-In parameters however, as having two of the same parameter with different types will break your Animator Controller, so if people merge other controllers that use the parameter with the original type, this will break the Animator Controller.

| **IsLocal**                    | True if the avatar is being worn locally, false otherwise.

| **ScaleModified**              | Returns true if the user is scaled using avatar scaling, false if the avatar is at its default size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Bool               | Playable       | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **ScaleFactor**                | Relation between the avatar's default height and the current height. An avatar with a default eye-height of 1m scaled to 2m will report 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Float              | Playable       | Used as a fix for scaling animations, but not great for systems since they rely on upload height.

| **ScaleFactorInverse**         | Inverse relation (1/x) between the avatar's default height and the current height. An avatar with a default eye-height of 1m scaled to 2m will report 0.5. Might be inaccurate at extremes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Float              | Playable       | Used as a fix for scaling animations, but not great for systems since they rely on upload height.

Recommended parameter to use for scaling fixes. More at [Designing Scale-Friendly Systems](/docs/Other/Scale-Friendly)  |
| **EyeHeightAsPercent**         | Relation of the avatar's eye height in meters relative to the default scaling limits (0.2-5.0). An avatar scaled to 2m will report (2.0 - 0.2) / (5.0 - 0.2) = 0.375.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Float              | Playable       | Used as a fix for scaling, will be outside the 0-1 range if the world allows big scaling.

| **IsAnimatorEnabled**          | Gets set to false one frame before the avatar’s animation is disabled (due to distance culling), set to true when re-enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Bool               | None           | Used to allow systems to get to a valid state before disabling.                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Sync Mode {#997ef8a65ccf4778a5300de3a577c881}


There are three sync types:

- **Speech**: Only used for Visemes and other Speech-related variables. Synced as fast as audio syncs, since it’s directly driven by the audio
- **Playable**: A sync mode which updates every 0.1 to 1 second as needed based on parameter changes. VRC Expression Parameters are synced with Playable sync
- **IK**: A sync which always syncs every 0.1 seconds, and interpolates `float` values for remote users. IK (so placement of humanoid bones) is also synced with IK sync
